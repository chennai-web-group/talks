# Talks Gallery

This talks repo serves two different purpose:
- **Archive**
- **Talk Suggestions**

## Archive

The Archive will contain details of all the talks done in the previous events. The archive can be accessed via this [main talks page](https://chennai-web-group.netlify.com/talks). If you want to contribute to the content of this talks page, kindly fork and modify the [talks.json](https://github.com/chennai-web-group/talks/blob/master/talks.json) file in this repo. This file contains the details of all the talks in JSON format.

## Talk Suggestion

If you have an topic on top of your head regarding anything that related to the web and the surrounding ecosystem and you want someone who has hands-on experience about the topic to talk about,kindly add the topic to the list by raising a [issue in this repo](https://github.com/chennai-web-group/talks/issues). This will help interesting speakers to pick topic easily as well as will help us to find talents to talk about your favorite topics!

If you are aspiring to give a talk, please feel free to pick any topic from the [requested list](https://github.com/chennai-web-group/talks/labels/request)
